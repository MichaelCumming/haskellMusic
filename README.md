###Music using Haskell
by Michael Cumming
2013-12-04

This is the beginning code for music code written in Haskell by Michael Cumming. First, I will explore the most basic music theory, such as standard scales, inversions and chord progressions. 

Perhaps later I will use this code to export chord progressions using midi generation code such as found in [Haskore] (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskore). This midi data I will then import into Abelton Live and hear how it sounds.
